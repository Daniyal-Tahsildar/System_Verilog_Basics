## Directory Specifications:

This directory is a continuation of **[Classes and Methods I](Classes%20and%20Methods%20I)** that devels deeper into Object Oriented Programming in `SystemVerilog`. It consists of complex examples that demonstrates advance features available for classes and methods.

*The suggested order to read the files is as follows:*

- **[Extern Methods](extern_usage.sv):**
  - Explains the distinction in memory allocation and array operations between packed and unpacked arrays.

- **[Constant Class Properties](const_class_property.sv):**
  - Discusses various methods of declaring multidimensional arrays, array allocation, and memory utilization.

- **[Pure Virtual Methods](pure_virtual.sv):**
  - Highlights the differences between static and dynamic arrays.
  - Demonstrates different usage scenarios of `new()` and other dynamic array methods.
 
- - **[Polymorphism with Inherited Classes](inheritance_and_polymorphism):**
 
- **[Class Parameterization](class_parameterization):**
  - Explores different queue types, data allocation, and access methods.
  - The [Example](queue_and_DA.sv) showcases how queues integrate with Dynamic arrays and accessing queue elements at specific locations.

- **[Interface Classes](interface_class.sv):**
  - Illustrates various ways of declaring associative arrays and accessing elements.
  - Explains how queues can be assigned associative array data and index values.
  - Presents different associative array methods.
  - Offers an example demonstrating associative arrays' behavior as linked lists.

- **[Nested Classes](nested_scope.sv):**
  - Encompasses searching, ordering, and reduction methods used across different array types: static arrays, dynamic arrays, queues, and associative arrays.
  - Clarifies the usage of the `with()` clause with various examples.
  - Discusses [array locator methods](Array_manipulation_methods/array_locator.sv), [array ordering methods](Array_manipulation_methods/array_ordering.sv), and [array reduction methods](Array_manipulation_methods/array_reduction.sv) in detail.
 
- - **[Object Copying](object_copying):**
