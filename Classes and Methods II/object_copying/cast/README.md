## Directory Specifications:

This directory contains example code illustrating different usecases of casting.

*The suggested order to read the files is as follows:*

- **[Simple Cast](simple_cast.sv):**
  - Explains the distinction in memory allocation and array operations between packed and unpacked arrays.

- **[Cast using a bit variable](using_bit_variable):**
  - Discusses various methods of declaring multidimensional arrays, array allocation, and memory utilization.

- **[Cast using a typedef](using_typedef):**
  - Highlights the differences between static and dynamic arrays.
  - Demonstrates different usage scenarios of `new()` and other dynamic array methods.
 
- **[Cast using a typedef with inline constraints](using_typedef_with_constraints):**
  - Explores different queue types, data allocation, and access methods.
  - The [Example](queue_and_DA.sv) showcases how queues integrate with Dynamic arrays and accessing queue elements at specific locations.
